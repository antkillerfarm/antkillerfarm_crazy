This is an example of using OpenGL vertex and fragment shaders with the new OpenGL features of Qt5.

Shaders are based on GLSL 1.30 for compatibility with Intel's open source Linux drivers.

The code is based on Dr. Sean Harmer's talk "OpenGL with Qt 5" given at Qt Developer Days 2012. The presentation can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYa5DLV6ADQ
